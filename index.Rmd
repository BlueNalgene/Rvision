## Description

[`Rvision`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/Rvision) is a - small but growing - 
computer vision library for [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org). It is based on 
the powerful [`OpenCV`](http://opencv.org/) library for C/C++, the state-of-the-art
for computer vision in the open source world. 

The ultimate goal of [`Rvision`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/Rvision) is to 
provide [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org) users with all the necessary functions 
to read and manipulate images, videos and camera streams, with an emphasis on 
speed (thanks to [`OpenCV`](http://opencv.org/)). In this respect, it is different
from all the other image manipulations packages for [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org)
that either can not quickly and directly access frames from videos or camera 
streams or are limited in their processing speed and/or volume.

## FAQ

### Can I take selfies with my webcam using [`Rvision`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/Rvision)?

You certainly can, but ask yourself first whether you should...

```r
my_stream <- stream(0)   # 0 will start your default webcam in general. 
my_selfie <- readNext(my_stream)
plot(my_selfie)
release(my_stream)
```

Be careful, this will trigger the explosion of your camera if it detects that 
you are making a duck face ;-)
