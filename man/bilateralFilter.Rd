\title{Edge-Preserving Noise Reduction with a Bilateral Filter}
\usage{
bilateralFilter(image, d = 5, sigma_color = 25, sigma_space = 25)
}
\arguments{
\item{image}{An \code{\link{Image}} object.}

\item{d}{The diameter in pixels of the filter neighborhood (default: 5).}

\item{sigma_color}{The filter standard deviation in the color space
(see Note; default: 25).}

\item{sigma_space}{The filter standard deviation in the coordinate space
(see Note; default: 25).}
}
\value{
image An \code{\link{Image}} object.
}
\description{
\code{bilateralFilter} applies the bilateral filter to an image.
 This filter can reduce unwanted noise very well while keeping edges fairly
 sharp. However, it is very slow compared to most filters.
}
\note{
A larger value of \code{sigma_color} means that farther colors within
 the pixel neighborhood will be mixed together, resulting in larger areas of
 semi-equal color.

A larger value of \code{sigma_space} means that farther pixels will
 influence each other as long as their colors are close enough. When
 \code{d > 0}, it specifies the neighborhood size regardless of
 \code{sigma_space}. Otherwise, \code{d} is proportional to \code{sigma_space}.
